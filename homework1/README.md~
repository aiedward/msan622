## Instructions ##

Prior to running my code, please install the following packages.
- `ggplot2`
- `reshape2`
- `devtools`

Also, To keep PNG files, please specify your working directory before running the code because by using `setwd()`. 

In summary, the following is the R code to run my code.

```
library(devtools)
setwd("/your_working_directory") 
source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yosukekatada/msan622/9df534c38d8d635dc12849195763b8ccb9aa886b/homework1/MSAN622_HW1.R")
```


## Discussion 1: Movies Data##

Although I expected that "budget" is somewhat positively correlated to "rating", it is not true. Even if the budget is almost zero, many movies have high ratings. Also, I notice that the range of rating converges as the budget increases. 

In terms of customization of the chart, I enlarged the fonts of title, the labels on the axes for making the audience easily understand them.

According to the bar chart below, the distribution is not uniform. Therefore, I can guess that each genre has different partter on scatter plot of "budget vs rating".

As well as the first chart, I made the font size bigger. Also, in order to make the audience easily read the labels, I rotated the chart because the most important information is genre in this chart. Finally, I chaged color from the default color to the darker blue because I want the audience not to pay attention to the meanings of the color itself.

When I look at the scatter plot about "budgte vs rating" like the first plot, there looks major two patters. First patter is that the range of rating converges as the budget increases. Action, Comedy, Drama, Mixed, and None fall in this pattern. The second pattern is that budget is almost zero and rating has large variation. Documentary and Short are in this pattern. Animation and Romance are fitted in those two patterns. Regarding Animation, budget is unrelated to rating. When it comes to Romance, I cannot see the explicit pattern. 

When the audience looks at this plot, the most important information is the differences among the distributions. Therefore, I made the legend's font bigger.

## Discussion 2: Stock Data##

The following line chart shows the trends for major European stock indices during 1990s. Overall, all the indicies have the same trend, but you would notice that Swiss Market Index (SMI) went up more sharply than other indices from 1995. On the other hand, the growth of FTSE, representing London Stock Exchange, was slower. 

As the discussion above, the important points are the trend of each index. So, In terms of the apperance on the chart, I enlarged legend's fonts as well as x and y axis labels.
